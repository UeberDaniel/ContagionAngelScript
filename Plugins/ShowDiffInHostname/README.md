# Contagion AngelScript Plugin: ShowDiffInHostname
###### This plugin does NOT set the game into custom mode, therefore it does NOT trigger the associated achievements lock.

## DESCRIPTION:

This plugin will allow you to display a custom text based on the server difficulty behind the hostname.
Each difficulty has a ConVar which can be changed in this configfile or at runtime on your server/client console.
